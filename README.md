# Week one code refractor challenge

Bootcamp week one challenge to improve accessibility on a website 

## Description 

In this challenge a marketing agency has given me the task to refactor an existing site to make it more accesible. This ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Creating an accessible website can benefit businesses in a number of ways, such as improving their search engine rankings and avoiding potential legal action from individuals with disabilities who may be unable to access the site.

For this challenge I have taken updated the old html with non semantic elements "div" to follow a semantic html markup. I have also updated CSS selectors and consolidated similar elements to follow the semantic structure. 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

Website must meet accessibility standards. To achieve this:

<li>Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code</li>
<li>HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</li>    
<li>Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes</li>
<li>Heading attributes fall in sequential order</li>
<li>Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title</li>
